    "# Covid19 Food Insecurity Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "SJ Terp\n",
    "2020-03-27\n",
    "Version 4.0\n",
    "\n",
    "We were asked to look for which countries might need a \"food airlift\" during the Covid19 pandemic.  There are many reasons this might happen, for example sick farmers and fishermen unable to tend crops and livestock, or fish from boats; agricultural distribution issues in and between countries when supply-chains are focussed on medical and essentials etc.  The issue that this notebook takes a (very rough) look at is the effect on food supply chains and food security of countries if country borders are closed, e.g. if imports and exports of food stop or dwindle to a low level. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are longer notes about this.  The TL;DR is that one place to start with these calculations is with existing calculations of food security, and remove the import and export components of them.  A good first source is the FAO, which maintains \"Food Balance Sheets\" for 209 countries and regions of the world at http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS. Reading the web notes ('definitions and standards') for this dataset, we see that if we download the dataset, the number we want for each country is (Item Code = 2901, Element Code = 664), aka the Grand Total for each country of its Food supply in kilocalories per capita per day (e.g. the Grand Total for Canada is around 3000 kcal available per person per day).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The country Grand Total kcal/capita/day is the sum of kcal/capita/day across a set of items (e.g. Meat), each of which is the sum of a lower level of items (e.g. Pigmeat, Poultry etc).  The web notes for the dataset also contains an 'Item Group' list describing this structure, which we'll use in our calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timewise, the FAO Food Balance Sheets go up to 2017. That's recent enough for a rough calculation. The FAO has also left enough raw data in the balance sheets for us to do the rough recalculations that we need. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions and caveats\n",
    "* This dataset only covers 207 countries and areas of the world. Action: Check to see if other countries are left out, and if they are, how we could proxy their figures\n",
    "* These approximations are based on 2017 numbers. They're not that old, but climate effects on crops have moved quickly in the past couple of years. \n",
    "* We're only calculating using the top level of the Item Group hierachy. We're doing rough calculations, so doing them over all possible items seemed a little over the top. \n",
    "* ACTION: Usually food security calculations average over 3 years to get a smoothed annual score, so should do that here too. \n",
    "* Some of the original numbers look... a little healthier than expected? Might need to be cautious with any self-reported data. \n",
